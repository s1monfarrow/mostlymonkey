# The Reading List

I’ve tried to group them a bit, obviously it’s complicated.

## DevOps

### [Infrastructure as Code: Managing Servers in the Cloud](http://amzn.to/2aAfO7g)
Worth it for the detail on the anti-patterns alone. A really very useful reference. The later chapters around CI/CD for infrastructure is essential reading.

### [The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win](http://amzn.to/2agYRSV)
If you have read “The Goal” then you have read this. If not then read this. Not the best written novel ever but still interesting.

### [Architecting for Scale](http://amzn.to/2agYrMf)
This is particularly useful for its view of scalable architecture from the business’s point of view.

### [Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems](http://amzn.to/2aMsfjE)
This is a set of collated and edited blog posts, they are written by the people that we all copy though. If you are trying to lay out a vision of where you want to be as an enterprise this will give some inspiration to draw on.

### [Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases Through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation](http://amzn.to/2atuGZE)
A classic, required reading. I should have read it before I started doing it as opposed to the other way round.

## Data
[I Heart Logs: Event Data, Stream Processing, and Data Integration](http://amzn.to/2agYxmZ)

[Big Data: Principles and best practices of scalable realtime data systems](http://amzn.to/2arzlat)

## Writing
[The Elements of Style](http://amzn.to/2agZ3l3)
