# Architecture Consultant
Hi I’m an independent architecture consultant. The consultant part of that doesn’t mean a flash suit, more that its extremely easy to fire me.

## Whats with the domain name
Every one of us is genetically 98% chimp, a lot of the ways that we react to things are based around that. Its useful to remember.

## So what does an Architecture Consultant actually do?
I think that the general idea is that I’ve made lots of mistakes so hopefully I’ll be able to help other people avoid them.

Being woken up at 3am by text messages from Pingdom and Nagios is about the least fun thing ever. Especially when those are closely followed by the CEO of the company phoning and asking if you know *how much money we are losing*.

As an aside pointing out that your just not making it and not actually losing it really doesn’t help.

It could always be worse though, you could be the on the [Devops team at Knight Capital](http://dougseven.com/2014/04/17/knightmare-a-devops-cautionary-tale/)

## Rules of the Road
To give you some idea of my opinions on stuff I’ve written a [little guide](/rulesoftheroad.html) that has a list of things that I think are a good/bad idea.

## Microservices
A short rant about micro-services, well [some of the potential issues](/microservices.html) with them.

## Random Idea
[Some of them](ideas.md) are really quite random
